Hi I am Kartavya from Delhi,India with many big dreams to achieve in the coming brighter future.
I am interested in playing chess and reading books from the very beginning althought now quite inclined towards programming and software development.
I am free for conversation and would love to have productive time with great people around for the better progress towards the goals.
I am open for any kind of love from the ranges of data entry to data analysis with the sort of expertise I have and with learning ahead.
I can invest any number of hours since I am in my learning phase and would love to learn new things.
